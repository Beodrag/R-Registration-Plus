R'Registration Plus

Chrome Extension I designed and developed a Google Chrome extension in Javascript that reconstructs the 
UCR Registration portal into a much more aesthetic and versatile page. The extension embeds a course difficulty
database as well as Rate My Professor links into the registration portal. It also corrects existing bugs and issues with the portal.
